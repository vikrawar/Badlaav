# Editing Instructions

Your task is to scan all files in this folder and process only Word (.docx) and PowerPoint (.pptx) files.

1. Open and read each document or slide deck.  
2. Identify gendered language (he/him/his, she/her/hers, mankind, chairman, etc.).  
3. Rewrite text so that it is gender neutral, while keeping meaning, clarity, and tone intact.  
   - Prefer neutral pronouns (they/them/their).  
   - Replace gendered job titles with neutral alternatives (e.g., “chairperson,” “firefighter”).  
   - Avoid introducing awkward phrasing; keep sentences natural.   
4. If changes are approved, apply them directly in the file using the helper Python scripts.  
5. Save updated files in place, preserving original formatting as much as possible.
